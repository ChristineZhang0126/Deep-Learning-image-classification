# Deep-Learning-image-classification
This summer, I worked with a professor in University of Alberta. We were developing deep learning architectures for material selection and structural damage detection.
We were training our deep learning model to handle image classification, and one of the tasks I did was implement data augmentation techniques. 
I was trying to improve the model's ability to generalize and accurately detect structural faults by exploring extra data augmentation methods like CutMix, Cutout, Mixup, and GridMask.
